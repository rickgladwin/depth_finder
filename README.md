# Depth Finder

A simple utility to calculate the depth of arrays, key-value objects, etc.

## Array Depth

The highest level of nesting found in the array

## Object Depth

The highest level of nesting found in the object

## Other Depths

Strings, numbers, etc. are defined as zero.

# Note:
The `depth_finder_mongoose` module has mongoose as a dependency,
in order to handle Mongoose/mongodb data types.

The `depth_finder` module will work without the mongoose dependency.
